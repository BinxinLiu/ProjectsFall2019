We aim to analyze the locations, times, and public discourse around gun shootings in America to
achieve the following main objectives:
1. Identify trends in terms of geography, demographic, general public sentiment, economy, etc.
for shootings.
2. Devise a predictive model that leverages social media responses, public discourse through
news articles, etc. surrounding the shooting date, and other geographical and economic
characteristics to identify high risk regions for shootings.
